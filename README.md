- Ultra fast: uses your local network for transferring. Internet speed is not a limit.
- Easy to use: intuitive UI. You know how to use it when you see it.
- Secure: uses state-of-the-art cryptography algorithm. No one else can see your files.
- No cellular data: outside? No problem. LANDrop can work on your personal hotspot, without consuming cellular data.
- No compression: doesn't compress your photos and videos when sending.

    ```
    sudo apt install libsodium-dev
    ```
